\section{Qualitative findings}

I'm not going into any of these in detail because I'm not sure if they should go in.

\subsection{The Miley Cyrus affect}

\begin{itemize}
\item last batch of HITs had several references to Miley Cyrus
\item previously, this pop culture reference never came up
\item suggests the pool of available ideas is time-sensitive
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reward vs Relative Reward in Completion Time}

\begin{itemize}
\item HITs with more overall reward perform faster, despite same payout per idea
\item design implications
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Comment on the effect of single participants - the zoomed in 75'er effect.
\end{itemize}
