%\section{Future Work}

%The most immediate step that follows this work is to examine the same phenomena for multiple questions. A design space for brainstorming taks must be defined and tested to see how variations impact the rate of idea generation, originality, etc.


%The saturation point of unique ideas and categories presents an obstacle to large-scale brainstorming on microtask marketplaces. One could conceivably develop interventions to overcome and reset this stagnation behaviour. For example, ideas from previous responders could be interspersed in response fields of the task to promote riffing or combination. 




%The change in idea and category o-scores at the 20 instance point is reflected in other metrics not discussed in this paper. It is likely this represents a distinct strategy change. By modelling this strategy change explicitly, we may be able to identify more explicitly when this change happens and make predictions about later strategies based on those employed early in the brainstorming run.
