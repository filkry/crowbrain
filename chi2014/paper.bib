Upon completion of the experiment, a table of random numbers was used to divide the forty-eight individual subjects into twelve nominal groups of four men each. The performance of each nominal group was then scored as though its members had actually worked together. The achievement of these nominal groups thus provided a measure of the performance to be expected if group participation neither facilitates nor inhibits creative thinking. When compared with that of the twelve nominal groups, the performance of the twelve real groups was found to be markedly inferior with respect to: (a) mean total number of ideas produced; (b) mean number of unique ideas produced; (c) three different measures which weighted the ideas produced differentially with respect to quality. To the extent that the results of the present experiment can be generalized, it must be concluded that group participation when using brainstorming inhibits creative thinking.},

@article{amabile_1983,
Abstract = {States that both the popular creativity tests, such as the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, and the subjective assessment techniques used in some previous creativity studies are ill-suited to social psychological studies of creativity. A consensual definition of creativity is presented, and as a refinement of previous subjective methods, a reliable subjective assessment technique based on that definition is described. The results of 8 studies testing the methodology in elementary school and undergraduate populations in both artistic and verbal domains are presented, and the advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed. The present methodology can be useful for the development of a social psychology of creativity because of the nature of the tasks employed and the creativity assessments obtained. Creativity assessment is discussed in terms of the divergent aims and methods of personality psychology and social psychology. (46 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA},
