<p>Thank you for participating in this ongoing study. If you are interested in seeing the results of the research, please email me (fil.krynicki@uwaterloo.ca) and I will make sure to contact you when it is complete.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to explore techniques for modelling ideas generated by crowd brainstorming. We predict that it will be possible to characterize the space of ideas and make accurate statements as to the number of "new ideas" remaining.</p>

<p>Once again, all data submitted will be made publicly available. However, we will not associate your Mechanical Turk ID with the data you submit.</p>

<p>Should you have any comments or concerns you could also contact the Director in the Office of Research Ethics at 519-888-4567, ext. 36005 or maureen.nummelin@uwaterloo.ca. This project was reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, the Office of Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
